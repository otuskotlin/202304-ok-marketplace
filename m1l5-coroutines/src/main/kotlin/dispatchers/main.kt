// When launch { ... } is used without parameters, it inherits the context (and thus dispatcher) from the CoroutineScope it is being launched from. In this case, it inherits the context of the main runBlocking coroutine which runs in the main thread.
//
// The Dispatchers.Unconfined coroutine dispatcher starts a coroutine in the caller thread, but only until the first suspension point. After suspension it resumes the coroutine in the thread that is fully determined by the suspending function that was invoked. The unconfined dispatcher is appropriate for coroutines which neither consume CPU time nor update any shared data (like UI) confined to a specific thread.
//
// On the other side, the dispatcher is inherited from the outer CoroutineScope by default. The default dispatcher for the runBlocking coroutine, in particular, is confined to the invoker thread, so inheriting it has the effect of confining execution to this thread with predictable FIFO scheduling.
// The unconfined dispatcher is an advanced mechanism that can be helpful in certain corner cases where dispatching of a coroutine for its execution later is not needed or produces undesirable side-effects, because some operation in a coroutine must be performed right away. The unconfined dispatcher should not be used in general code.
//
// The default dispatcher that is used when no other dispatcher is explicitly specified in the scope. It is represented by Dispatchers.Default and uses a shared background pool of threads.
//
// newSingleThreadContext creates a thread for the coroutine to run. A dedicated thread is a very expensive resource. In a real application it must be either released, when no longer needed, using the close function, or stored in a top-level variable and reused throughout the application.
